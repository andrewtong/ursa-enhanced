v0.2 June 5th 2015

URSA-enhanced now supports most error types and performs functionally with minimal bugs.  The predictions have all been done
via lazy evaluatons and hashmap lookups allowing the algorithm to operate in linear time.  Scoring is not perfectly accurate 
at the moment but will likely be fixed in the nearby future.  The source code has been sigificantly updated since the previous
version to account for many more error types including letter swaps, letter corrections, missing indexes, and the handling
of duplicate letters/indexes.  The details behind the hashing equations and how the hashmap operates is found in the 
"computation" markdown file.

The explanation behind the theory of URSA-enhanced is now more detailed in the readme and provides an explanation behind the 
approach of the problem.  


v0.1

This version is the introduction of URSA-enhanced.  The theory behind this project can be found in the readme.md file.  Currently
URSA-enhanced can handle very basic fuzzy string matching cases, and will always run in linear time.  I am very glad to finally
introduce this project as the theory required a significant amount of work to build up to and this project certainly has 
a lot of potential.  

URSA-enhanced will be continually improved to handle many more complex cases.  It is still currently in work, but this version
serves as an introduction to see how the code is layed out and how the estimation processes work.

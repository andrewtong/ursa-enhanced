v0.1

This version is the introduction of URSA-enhanced.  The theory behind this project can be found in the readme.md file.  Currently
URSA-enhanced can handle very basic fuzzy string matching cases, and will always run in linear time.  I am very glad to finally
introduce this project as the theory required a significant amount of work to build up to and this project certainly has 
a lot of potential.  

URSA-enhanced will be continually improved to handle many more complex cases.  It is still currently in work, but this version
serves as an introduction to see how the code is layed out and how the estimation processes work.
